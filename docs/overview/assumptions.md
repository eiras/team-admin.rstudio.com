The course covers some of the options for configuring RStudio Team products with a **solutions-first approach** that highlights settings and configurations along the way.

As an attendee you should be **comfortable in the Linux terminal** but you donâ€™t need strong R skills.

However, we expect most students on this course to be:

* most likely R literate AND
* interested in what RStudio products can do AND
* interested in understanding how to configure the server.
